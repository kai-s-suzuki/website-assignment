# About Kai

Hi! I am a third-year Environmental Studies (B.S) student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have my associates degree from Orange Coast College in Orange County, where I grew up. I am very passionate about conservation; I have interned at the Storke Ranch Vernal Pools doing restoration and have contributed to long-term monitoring of aquatic invertebrates at the North Campus Open Space alongside the Cheadle Center.
