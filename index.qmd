Hi! My name is Kai Suzuki and I am a third-year Environmental Studies (B.S) student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am very passionate about conservation; I have interned at the Storke Ranch Vernal Pools performing restoration and have contributed to long-term monitoring of aquatic invertebrates at the North Campus Open Space, alongside the Cheadle Center.

Outside of school and work, you can find me drinking coffee, cooking, gardening, running, and watching baseball.
