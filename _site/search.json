    "text": "Beginnings\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been involved in all kinds of sports. Despite not having much success in soccer and baseball, they set a strong competitive baseline in me. In my sophomore year of high school, I joined the track team where my perfect attendance at practices and consistent work led to improvement and two captain roles. I really cherished my short three years with the team, but I left discouragement after a frustrating senior year of injuries and underwhelming results.\n\n\nConsistency\nDuring my time in community college, I never got into a routine of running. Once I moved into my apartment after transferring schools, I had the North Campus Open Space and the Elwood Mesa as my backyard. Having the rare combination of clean air, endless dirt trails, and year-round greenery made running much more enjoyable than the concrete sidewalks of my suburban hometown. Running is something I look forward to and I try to fit about three runs a week into my schedule.\n\n\nAccessiblity\nSocial media discourse in 2025 about a running influencer collaborating with the White House Press Secretary brought massive attention to how interconnected running and politics are. An administration that guts clean air regulations, cuts programs that provide healthy food to kids, and targets transgender athletes, should not be welcomed by the running community. The conversation made me further realize how much of a privilege it is to run with access to adequate food and gear. It is a goal of mine to work towards making running more accessible through tangible actions, such as working with the Associated Students of UCSBâ€™s Edible Campus Program and Department of Public Worms who both help fight food insecurity on campus by providing fresh produce to all students."
